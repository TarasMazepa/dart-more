Various extension libraries that make Dart a better place.

  stores bits.

  and operations on strings.
- `fraction.dart` provides support for rational number arithmetic.
- `int_math.dart` is a collection of common mathematical functions on ints.
- `iterable.dart` is a collection of iterables and iterators.
- `ordering.dart` a fluent interface for building comparator functions.

  progressions.
  
And there is more to come ...
