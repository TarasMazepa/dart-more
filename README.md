More Dart - Literally
=====================

Various extension libraries that make Dart a better place.

- `bit_set.dart` provides a space efficent array data structure that compactly 
  stores bits.
- `char_matcher.dart` provides a model for character classes, their composition
  and operations on strings.
- `range.dart` provides a function to create iterables yielding arithmetic 
  progressions.
